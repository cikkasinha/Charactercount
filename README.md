# Charactercount
This PowerShell script prompts the user to enter a server name through an input box and then displays the character count of the server name in a message box. It utilizes .NET assemblies to create user-friendly graphical interfaces for input and output, enhancing usability and interaction.
It has an user friendly exe which can be used without interacting with powershell.
